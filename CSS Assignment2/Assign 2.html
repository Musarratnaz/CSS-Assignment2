            Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To
            entertain himself, he sang out, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” When the villagers heard the
            cry, they ran up the hill to drive the wolf away. But when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was
